    <b>Q3. 3: List and describe the five primitive data types in JavaScript.</b>
    <p>Certainly! Here are the five primitive data types in JavaScrip</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        STRINGS:- Strings represent sequences of characters and are used to
        store textual data. They are enclosed in single (' '), double (" "), or
        backtick (` `) quotes.
      </li>
      <li>
        NUMBERS:-Numbers represent numeric values, including integers and
        floating-point numbers. JavaScript does not differentiate between
        integers and floating-point numbers; they are both considered as
        numbers.
      </li>
      <li>
        BOOLEANS:-Booleans represent logical values, either true or false. They
        are often used in conditional statements and logical operations.
      </li>
      <li>
        UNDEFINED:-The undefined data type is used to represent a variable that
        has been declared but not assigned a value. It is also the default value
        of function parameters that are not provided.
      </li>
      <li>
        NULL:-The null data type is a special value that represents the absence
        of any object value. It is often used to intentionally indicate the
        absence of a value.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <b
      >Q4. What is the purpose of declaring variables in JavaScript, and how do
      you declare them using the 'let' keyword?</b
    >
    <p>
      The purpose of declaring variables in JavaScript is to store and
      manipulate data. The 'let' keyword is used for variable declaration,
      allowing you to assign a name to a value. For example: let age = 25
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, 'age' is the variable name, and '25' is the initial value assigned
      to it. 'let' is preferred for modern JavaScript variable declaration due
      to its block-scoping behavior.
    </p>
    <b
      >Q5. Explain the importance of comments in JavaScript and provide examples
      of single-line and multi-line comments.</b
    >
    <p>
      Comments in JavaScript play a crucial role in code documentation,
      readability, and communication. They provide information about the code to
      developers, making it easier to understand, maintain, and collaborate on
      projects. Here's the importance of comments along with examples of
      single-line and multi-line comments:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Comments help explain the purpose and functionality of different parts
        of your code. This is especially useful for complex algorithms, business
        logic, or any section that might not be immediately obvious.
      </li>
      <li>
        Comments serve as a form of documentation, helping other developers (or
        even yourself in the future) understand the codebase. They provide
        insights into the reasoning behind certain decisions or implementations.
      </li>
      <li>
        Comments can be used to temporarily disable or comment out sections of
        code during debugging, allowing you to test different parts of your
        program without deleting or modifying the original code.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <b
      >Single-line comments start with "//" and extend to the end of the line.
      They are commonly used for brief explanations or comments on a specific
      line of code.</b
    ><br />
    <b
      >Multi-line comments begin with "/" and end with "/". They are suitable
      for longer explanations or commenting out multiple lines of code.</b

    <b>Q6. 6: Explain the importance of choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names in JavaScript.
        Provide an example where using a clear identifier improves code readability.</b >
  <p>Choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names in JavaScript is crucial for code readability and maintainability. Well-named variables make it easier for developers (including yourself) to understand the purpose and content of a variable, reducing the likelihood of errors and improving the overall quality of the code. Here's an example illustrating the importance of clear variable names:</p>
  <b>Examples let x = 10;</b>
  </body>

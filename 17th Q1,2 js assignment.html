      >Question 1: Explain what JavaScript is and its role in web
      development.</b
    >
    <p>
      JavaScript is a versatile and widely-used programming language primarily
      employed for web development. It plays a crucial role in enhancing the
      interactivity and dynamic behavior of websites. Here are key aspects of
      JavaScript and its role in web development:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>JavaScript is mainly executed on the client side, meaning it runs in the user's web browser rather than on the server. This enables it to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), which represents the structure and content of a web page, in real-time.</li>
        <li>JavaScript allows developers to create dynamic and interactive elements on web pages. For example, it can be used to update content, handle user input, and create responsive interfaces without the need for a page reload.</li>
        <li>JavaScript enables the handling of various events such as mouse clicks, keyboard input, and changes in form elements. Developers can define functions that respond to these events, making the user interface more engaging.</li>
        <li>JavaScript facilitates asynchronous communication with servers, allowing web pages to retrieve and send data without refreshing the entire page. This results in a smoother and more responsive user experience.</li>
        <li>JavaScript is supported by all major web browsers, making it a universal scripting language for client-side web development. Developers can write code that works consistently across different browsers.</li>
        <li>Numerous JavaScript frameworks and libraries, such as React, Angular, and Vue.js, have been developed to simplify and accelerate the process of building complex web applications. These tools provide pre-built components and abstractions that help manage the application state and structure.</li>
        <li>While JavaScript is primarily associated with client-side development, it is also used on the server side. With the introduction of platforms like Node.js, developers can use JavaScript to build scalable and high-performance server-side applications</li>
        <li>JavaScript can be used for cross-platform mobile app development through frameworks like React Native and Ionic. This allows developers to write code once and deploy it on multiple platforms, saving time and effort.</li>
    </ul>
    <b>Q2. Explain the key differences between JavaScript and HTML. Provide examples of situations where
        you would use each.</b>
        <p>JavaScript and HTML serve distinct roles in web development, and they are often used together to create dynamic and interactive web pages. Here are the key differences between JavaScript and HTML, along with examples of situations where each is typically employed:</p>
    <p>   <b> HTML (HyperText Markup Language):</b>
        Role: HTML is a markup language used for structuring the content of a web page. It provides the basic building blocks, or elements, to define the structure and layout of the page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more.</p>
        <b>EXAMPLE</b>
        <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Example Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
    <p>This is a sample paragraph.</p>
    <img src="example.jpg" alt="An example image">
    <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example.com</a>
    <b>2. JAVASCRIPT :-</b>
    <p>Role: JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. It allows developers to manipulate the DOM, handle events, and make asynchronous requests to servers, enabling the creation of responsive and interactive user interfaces.</p>
    <b>EXAMPLE</b>
    <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>JavaScript Example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1 id="greeting">Hello, Guest!</h1>
    
    <script>
      // JavaScript code to change the greeting dynamically
      var username = prompt("Enter your name:");
      var greetingElement = document.getElementById("greeting");
      greetingElement.innerHTML = "Hello, " + username + "!";
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
